This application was my first attempt at Javascript and HTML. It mimics the behaviour of standard e-commerce websites, however it utilizes the local storage of a computer,
instead of using an online database. This means that only one person may use the application at a time.

To start the application, please download all of these files and click on logmein.html. From there you can create an account, and proceed to log in with your credentials.
You will then be brought to the mainhub, which contains all of the items you may purchase. You can also upload your own items at the bottom of the page for a price of your
choosing, as well as see any other users uploaded items.
