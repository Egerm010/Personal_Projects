This game is purely text based, and should work in almost any Java compiler through printLn statements and user input.

As of now, two levels are available as the game is being revised (adding constructors and methods, as this project was originally made a long time ago). However,
the next levels mechanics may be viewed through the commented out lines if one wishes to see them.
